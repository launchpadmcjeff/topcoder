Problem Statement

John couldn't handle long strings so he came up with the idea of MicroStrings.



You are given two positive ints: A and D. These determine an infinite decreasing arithmetic 
progression: A, A-D, A-2D, and so on. Clearly, only finitely many elements of such a progression 
are non-negative.



Each such progression defines one MicroString, as follows: You take all the non-negative 
elements, convert each of them into a string, and then concatenate those strings (in order).



For example, let A=12 and D=5. For these values we get the arithmetic progression 
(12, 7, 2, -3, -8, ...). The non-negative elements are 12, 7, and 2. The corresponding 
strings are "12", "7", and "2". Their concatenation is the following MicroString: "1272".



Given A and D, return the MicroString they define.

 
Definition
    	
Class:	MicroStrings
Method:	makeMicroString
Parameters:	int, int
Returns:	String
Method signature:	String makeMicroString(int A, int D)
(be sure your method is public)
    
 
Notes
-	When converting a number to a string, the string must not have unnecessary leading zeros.
 
Constraints
-	A will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.
-	D will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.
 
Examples
0)	
    	
12
5
Returns: "1272"
This is the example from the problem statement.
1)	
    	
3
2
Returns: "31"
2)	
    	
31
40
Returns: "31"
3)	
    	
30
6
Returns: "3024181260"
The number 0 is also non-negative. When we convert it into a string, we get the string "0".
